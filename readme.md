Draughts
========

A tool for generating boilerplate for typed data objects. 


Notes:
 - Inplace, the dict you start with should still exist with the type corrections applied.
 - Lets IDEs check type annotations and attribute spelling.
 - Let you annotate fields with metadata that other systems 
   may need in order to process the document properly.
